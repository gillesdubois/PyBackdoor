# PyBackdoor

So, this code is a python backdoor originaly made on trusted sec.
Thanks to trsuted sec to make this code freely available :)

My ojective is to make a cross-platform op√©rational backdoor which can do some simple actions...
Executing shell commands, send / recieve file, take a pic of the infected computer are some feature that will be quickly integrated.

For windows : maybe use meterpreter shell in order to have some good feature :)

TODO :
  - Make a functionnal crossplatform shell executer.
  - Add persistence feature (Windows / unix / mac)
  - Encrypt connection
  - send and recieve files
